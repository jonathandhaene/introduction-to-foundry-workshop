# Sub-Lab 2.3: Cleanup Resources

[← Back to Lab 2 Overview](./README.md) | [← Previous: Sub-Lab 2.2](./sub-lab-2.2-add-voice-to-agent.md)

---

**⏱️ Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes

## Overview

In this sub-lab, you'll clean up all Azure resources created during Labs 1 and 2. This ensures you don't incur ongoing costs for resources you're no longer using.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This process is **irreversible**. All data, deployments, and configurations will be permanently deleted.

## 💻 Cleanup Instructions

### Step 1: Clean Up the Web App (Lab 1.5)

First, navigate to your webapp folder and remove all resources created by `azd`:

```powershell
cd lab-1-rag-chatbot/webapp
```

```powershell
# Remove all Azure resources created by azd
azd down --force --purge
```

This will:
- Delete the Container App and Container Apps Environment
- Delete the Container Registry
- Remove the Entra app registration
- Clean up all RBAC assignments

**Expected output:**
```
Deleting all resources and deployed code on Azure (azd down)
...
SUCCESS: Your application was removed from Azure.
```

---

### Step 2: Delete the Main Resource Group (Lab 1 & 2)

Now delete the main resource group containing your Foundry resources, AI Search, Storage, and model deployments:

> ✏️ **Replace `[yourname]`** with your actual name (same as Lab 1.1).

```powershell
# Delete the main resource group (this deletes EVERYTHING inside it)
az group delete `
  --name rg-foundry-workshop-[yourname] `
  --yes `
  --no-wait
```

> 💡 **Note**: The `--no-wait` flag returns immediately while deletion continues in the background. Full deletion takes 2-5 minutes.

---

### Step 3: Verify Cleanup

After a few minutes, verify the resources are deleted:

> ✏️ **Replace `[yourname]`** with your actual name (same as Lab 1.1).

```powershell
# Check if resource group still exists (should return error)
az group show --name rg-foundry-workshop-[yourname]
```

**Expected output** (if cleanup successful):
```
(ResourceGroupNotFound) Resource group 'rg-foundry-workshop-[yourname]' could not be found.
```

---

### Step 4: Clean Up Local Files (Optional)

If you want to remove the local workshop files as well:

```powershell
# Navigate to parent directory
cd ../..

# Remove the webapp folder (created by git clone in Lab 1.5)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force lab-1-rag-chatbot/webapp
```

---

## 🖥️ Portal Alternative

If you prefer to delete resources via the Azure Portal:

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to **Resource groups**
3. Select `rg-foundry-workshop-[yourname]`
4. Click **Delete resource group**
5. Type the resource group name to confirm
6. Click **Delete**

Repeat for `rg-rag-chatbot-app` (the webapp resource group).
