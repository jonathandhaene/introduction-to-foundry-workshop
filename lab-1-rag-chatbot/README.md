# Lab 1: Building a RAG-Enabled Chatbot

## 🎯 Lab Overview

In this lab, you'll build a chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities using Microsoft Foundry. By the end of this lab, you'll have a production-ready chatbot that can answer questions based on your custom knowledge base.

**Estimated Time**: 75-105 minutes (depending on path chosen)

## 🛤️ Choose Your Path

This lab offers two parallel paths. Choose the one that best fits your learning goals:

| Path | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **🖥️ Portal Path** | Use Azure Portal and Foundry UI exclusively | Quick setup, visual learners, no coding required |
| **💻 Code Path** | Build everything programmatically with Python and CLI | Developers, automation, deeper understanding |

> **Tip**: You can mix and match! Start with Portal to understand concepts, then try Code for specific sections.

## 📖 What You'll Learn

- **RAG Fundamentals**: Understanding how RAG works and is implemented in Azure
- **Azure AI Search**: Working with embeddings and semantic search on Azure
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Storing and managing your source documents
- **Microsoft Foundry**: Using the unified AI platform for deployment

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant context from a knowledge base. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG:

1. **Retrieves** relevant information from your documents
2. **Augments** the user's query with this context
3. **Generates** accurate, contextually-aware responses

### System Architecture

```
                                                    
                                                                      
User Query ──┬──→ Embedding → Vector Search → Relevant Context        
             │                                      │                  
             │                                      ↓                  
             └─────────────────────────────────→  LLM  ───→ Response   
                                                                     
                                                    
```

### Microsoft Services Used

| Component | Microsoft Service | Purpose |
|:----------|:------------------|:--------|
| **AI Platform** | Microsoft Foundry | Unified platform for building, deploying, and managing AI applications |
| **Knowledge Layer** | Foundry IQ | Manages knowledge bases with agentic retrieval and permission-aware responses |
| **Document Storage** | Azure Blob Storage | Stores your source documents (PDFs, text files, etc.) |
| **Vector Search** | Azure AI Search | Stores embeddings and performs semantic search |
| **Embedding Model** | Microsoft Foundry Model (text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-ada-002, etc.) | Converts text into numerical vectors |
| **LLM** | Microsoft Foundry Model (GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, etc.) | Generates natural language responses |

### How It All Fits Together

1. **Microsoft Foundry** is your central hub - it's where you create your project, manage models, and deploy your agent. It also provides both the embedding model (for search) and the LLM (for responses)
2. **Azure Blob Storage** is where you upload your source documents (company policies, FAQs, product info, etc.)
3. **Azure AI Search** indexes your documents, chunks them, creates embeddings, and enables semantic search
4. **Foundry IQ** connects it all together - it creates a knowledge base from your indexed data and uses agentic retrieval to provide your agent with permission-aware, grounded answers with citations

## 🏆 Bonus Challenges

Finished early? Try these challenges to deepen your understanding:

### 🥉 Beginner
- **Add a new document**: Create a `products.txt` file with detailed product specs and add it to the knowledge base. Ask the agent questions about it!
- **Change the agent's name**: Try naming your agent something creative instead of `RAG-Chatbot`.
- **Try different questions**: Ask the agent tricky questions — like "What is TechCorp's mascot?" — and see how well it grounds its answers.

### 🥈 Intermediate
- **Try a different chat model**: Swap `gpt-4.1-mini` for `gpt-4.1` and compare response quality and latency.
- **Customize the system prompt**: Change the agent's instructions to respond in a different language (e.g., French) or adopt a different persona.
- **Expand the knowledge base**: Add a `faq.txt` or `products_catalog.txt` with richer content and see how the agent handles new topics.

### 🥇 Advanced
- **Build a second agent**: Create a specialized "HR Policy Agent" with different documents and see how different system prompts affect the responses.
- **Explore Foundry IQ agentic retrieval**: Test complex multi-part questions that require combining information from multiple document chunks.
- **Add multilingual content**: Upload a document in a different language and see how the embedding model handles cross-lingual search.
