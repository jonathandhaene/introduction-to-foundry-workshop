## Step 6: Set Up Lab 2 (When Needed)

If you are planning on doing Lab 2 as well. Go back to the main folder (`cd ..`) and run:

```bash
cd lab-2-voice-capabilities
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ✅ Verification

To verify your setup is working (make sure your terminal is a git bash one)

```bash
python --version
# Should show Python 3.10 or higher

pip list | grep azure
# Should show azure packages after Lab 1 setup
```
